# Calculator for my school project
My computer science teacher told me this doesn't count as project for calc because <br>we are using python with some ui stuff thats prebuilted.
<br>Its not done yet
## What will the calc have when its done

### Operators
  - Simple ones
  - sin,cos,tan,and inverse
  - more
### Better ui
  - I'm going to update the ui at some point
  - its not gonna be so fancy
  - I might add something more than that
  - Its not gonna turn into a website with database just a calc
### Some special Elements in there
  - Like I mentioned, sin,cos,tan that and I'm adding
### When will it be done
  - Not now
  - I believe the main part will be before 2026
  - Extra will be before I get into rotation of computer science
  - Like about feb 20

## Why I made this

### ~~For fun~~ School
  - ~~Yeah I'm not lying~~
  - Also for school
