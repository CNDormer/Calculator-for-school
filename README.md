# Calculator for my school project
My computer science teacher told me this doesn't count as project for calc because <br>we are using python with some ui stuff thats prebuilted.



> [!IMPORTANT]
> **SOMEONE HELP ME WITH LOG**<br>
> This calc is still in early-developement.<br>
> Oh and when using negative number it will always show 0-1 **when nothing is up there**<br>
> **IF U WANT TO USE NEGATIV NUMBER USE PARENTHESIS**

> [!NOTE]
> Remind me to do the trig function in JS if you see this
> 
### Current progress
  - [x] HTML layout
  - [x] CSS for buttons and layout
  - [x] Set up JS
  - [x] Trig
  - [x] euler
  - [ ] More buttons
  - [ ] JS funtions
## What will the calc have when its done

### Operators
  - Simple ones
  - sin,cos,tan,and inverse(done)
  - more[^1]

[^1]: This kind of means the buttons that are like logarithm,algebra 2 type.
### Better ui
  - I'm going to update the ui at some point
  - its not gonna be so fancy
  - I might add something more than that
  - Its not gonna turn into a website with database just a calc
  - the ui currently looks like squres because I missed something on there that makes it looks like that and I don't know how to change it
    > I'm just lazy<br>
    > nvm squares are better
### Some special Elements in there
  - Like I mentioned, sin,cos,tan that and I'm adding
### When will it be done
  - Not now
  - I believe the main part will be before 2026
  - Extra will be before I get into rotation of computer science
  - Like about feb 20

## Why I made this

### ~~For fun~~ School
  - ~~Yeah I'm not lying~~
  - I thought I could make this so I don't have to do the calc with __Python__
  - He told me I can't so yeah
